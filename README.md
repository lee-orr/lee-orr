### Game Development Libraries
#### [Bevy Generative Grammars](https://github.com/lee-orr/bevy-generative-grammars)
This is a rust library for procedural generation using Grammars, with built in support for Tracery - as well as room to expand to other grammars. 

#### [Bevy Tilt Five](https://github.com/lee-orr/bevy-tilt-five)
This is an experimental bevy library for rendering to the tilt five. It is currently in a very early state.

### Development Related
#### [Spin Message Trigger](https://github.com/lee-orr/spin-message-trigger)
This is a plugin for [Fermyon Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) - allowing it to use message brokers as triggers for wasm modules, and to publish the results from these modules to message brokers. At the moment, it supports an In-Memory broker, Redis, and NATS, as well as creating an HTTP gateway for publishing to the broker & WebSocket connection for subscribing to messages on specific subjects.

#### [Rusty Dev Containers](https://github.com/lee-orr/rusty-dev-containers)
This repo contains a collection of useful dev container features, to make it easier to them up for rust development.
