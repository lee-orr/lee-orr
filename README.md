## Developer Tools
### [Spin Message Trigger](https://github.com/lee-orr/spin-message-trigger)
This is a plugin for [Fermyon Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) - allowing it to use message brokers as triggers for wasm modules, and to publish the results from these modules to message brokers. At the moment, it supports an In-Memory broker, Redis, and NATS, as well as creating an HTTP gateway for publishing to the broker & WebSocket connection for subscribing to messages on specific subjects.
