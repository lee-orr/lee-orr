info:
    company: Imbellus
    role: Senior Engineer
summary: Architected & Built an interactive, browser-based editor for complex game-like assessments. Created an engine for generating Vue components & backend logic from the editor's JSON output. Improved communication between Javascript & Unity - allowing the designer's logic to directly control the 3D visuals. Designed a server system that can be controlled by the visual editor - allowing for logic to run in-browser during editing, and on the server when deployed with no additional engineering. Assisted in the implementation of legacy assessments when necessary. Implemented LSP support & typing for designer-provided variables to allow for the use of typescript in the editor. Build a web-component based wrapper for isolated, independently deployable tasks running through configurable page with a single server connection.
