At Visual3D, my job was to build out mostly flash based websites for their clients. As a ad agency that specialised in video production, this was as added service the company provided it's clients - and priority was given to making the sites look great with smooth interactivity. Some of the sites also invovled a small amount of PHP and MySQL for back end development, or some Javascript and HTML, but most of the work was in Flash with Actionscript.
