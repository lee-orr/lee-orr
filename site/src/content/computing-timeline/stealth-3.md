*This contract is currently in progress.*

The client requested a site that is easy for them to customize with a robust design, and the need to add and adjust page contents arbitrarily. In addition, the site had to be hostable using services based in the EU, and utilize some self-hosted components such as an airtable replacement and analytics provider - while being managable without a dedicated system administrator.
