I wrote & taught the final course in the McMaster Continuing Education Back End program (which is part of their Full Stack program).

The course was designed to serve as an example to real world development processes, and to give the students a chance to practice their craft while introducing them to a wide variety of important elements in modern development.

It included an introduction to TypeScript, setting up a good development workflow with tools like Linting & CI/CD, the use of Software Architecture to manage complexity with an eye to coupling and cohesion, and the use of infrastructure such as reverse proxies, load balancers, and containers.
