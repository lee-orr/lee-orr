The project with Emile was a very short, intense project. The client had recieved notice that the chatbot platform they were using would be closing down within a few weeks, and needed help migrating off it. However, unlike other projects - they wanted to be directly involved in the process, since they wanted to learn how to maintain and develop the project further.

The service they were using was built around a proprietary fork of RiveScript, where they used some additional features not available in the core language. A significant part of my role was helping them build out their API in Firebase, get the chatbot to connect to Twilio for SMS communications, and create a fork of RiveScript that was able to mirror the features they were using - allowing them to avoid re-building the entire product from scratch.
