The main goal of this project was to replace an existing tool the client had built in MatLab, with a more modern and user friendly one. In addition, a large priority was the use of popular, easy to learn tools and robust tests and documentation - so that either the client or future grad students would be able to maintain the software once the contract ended. The tool had to allow users to draw tactonic plates, measured velocities of the earths crust, and more on a map - and display that information intuitively. It was built in a high-iteration process, with builds at every commit and integrating feedback from the client and his research collaborators at every step.
