This was a student employment opportunity at UofT. My main role was creating a prototype for a new student dashboard application based on jQuery Mobile for the UI & PHP + MySQL on the server. This was part of their early experimentation into reactive design, and my prototype was basically a proof-of-concept that you could create a portal that worked well on both mobile and desktop.
