I originally built this game as part of the Historically Accurate Game Jam - based on the theme of "The Industrial Revolution". After some research, I wound up deciding to focus on a period in the UK where canals became extremely popular, before trains took over. This game is essentially a puzzle game where you need to construct canals to reach specific locations for the lowest cost possible, with many of the maps inspired by real-world canal projects from the time!
