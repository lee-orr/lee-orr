title: Crossroad Blues
summary: As a lowly deamon in hell, getting souls is the name of the game... But actually getting a deal is hard with all the forces of heaven in the way. Fortunately - if someone goes to a crossroad & summons a deamon, you might just be able to get to them...

When [VimJam4](https://itch.io/jam/vimjam4) unveiled their theme, "Cross Paths", my mind immediately went to the legends around Robert Johnson's "Cross Road Blues". A classic story of a Faustian bargin, at a crossroad, in the dead of night. As I was playing with that concept, I realized it'd be fun to be a devil trying to gather souls with these deals, working their way up in the world. And so, the game "Crossroad Blues" was born.
